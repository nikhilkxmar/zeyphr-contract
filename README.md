## üìÅ Contracts

### 1. `ZeyphrAdmin.sol`
- **Purpose**: Handles platform-wide configurations such as marketplace fee and fee recipient account.
- **Features**:
  - Set and update `feeAccount` (address receiving marketplace fees).
  - Set and update `feePercent` (maximum 100).
  - Only the contract owner can perform updates.

### 2. `ZeyphrMarketplace.sol`
- **Purpose**: Main marketplace contract managing minting, listing, and buying NFTs.
- **Built with**:
  - `ERC721URIStorage` (OpenZeppelin)
  - `ReentrancyGuard` (security against reentrancy attacks)
  - `IERC721Receiver` (supports safe NFT transfers)
- **Features**:
  - Mint NFTs with:
    - `transferable = true`: behaves like standard ERC721
    - `transferable = false`: soulbound logic with `quantity` & `supply`
  - Listing/unlisting NFTs
  - Purchasing NFTs (single or bulk)
  - Fee deduction on purchase (to `feeAccount`)
  - Track buyers, owners, and NFT supply
